# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Execution Kernel documentation.

## A

### Action

A single instruction produced by an agent for execution on-chain. Actions have a type, target, and payload.

### ActionV1

The versioned action structure:
```rust
pub struct ActionV1 {
    pub action_type: u32,
    pub target: [u8; 32],
    pub payload: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### Agent

A program that makes capital allocation decisions. Agents are pure functions: given inputs, they produce outputs (actions).

### agent_code_hash

A SHA-256 hash of the agent's source code, computed at build time and embedded in the binary. Used to verify agent identity.

### `agent_entrypoint!`

A macro that generates kernel binding code directly in the agent crate, eliminating the need for a separate binding crate. Given an `agent_main` function, it generates `kernel_main()`, `kernel_main_with_constraints()`, and a `KernelError` re-export.

```rust
kernel_sdk::agent_entrypoint!(agent_main);
```

See [`agent_entrypoint!` in SDK Overview](/sdk/overview#agent_entrypoint).

### agent_id

A 32-byte identifier that uniquely identifies an agent within the protocol. Used for on-chain registration and authorization.

### `agent_input!`

A macro for declarative input parsing. Generates a struct with `decode()`, `encode()`, and `ENCODED_SIZE` for fixed-size binary input.

```rust
kernel_sdk::agent_input! {
    struct MyInput {
        target: [u8; 20],
        amount: u64,
    }
}
// MyInput::ENCODED_SIZE == 28
```

See [`agent_input!` Macro](/sdk/agent-input-macro) for full documentation.

### Agent Pack

A portable bundle format for distributing verifiable agents, containing metadata and cryptographic commitments.

### AgentContext

The execution context provided to agents:
```rust
pub struct AgentContext {
    pub protocol_version: u32,
    pub kernel_version: u32,
    pub agent_id: [u8; 32],
    pub agent_code_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub constraint_set_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub input_root: [u8; 32],
    pub execution_nonce: u64,
}
```

### AgentEntrypoint

The trait that agents implement to integrate with the kernel. Typically generated by the `agent_entrypoint!` macro rather than implemented manually:
```rust
pub trait AgentEntrypoint {
    fn code_hash(&self) -> [u8; 32];
    fn run(&self, ctx: &AgentContext, opaque_inputs: &[u8]) -> AgentOutput;
}
```

### AgentOutput

The structure returned by agents containing actions:
```rust
pub struct AgentOutput {
    pub actions: Vec<ActionV1>,
}
```

## B

### Basis Points (bps)

A unit of measurement equal to 1/100th of a percent. 10,000 bps = 100%. Used for leverage and percentage calculations.

## C

### `CallBuilder`

A fluent builder for constructing ABI-encoded `CALL` actions:

```rust
let action = CallBuilder::new(target_address)
    .selector(0x617ba037)
    .param_address(&asset)
    .param_u256_from_u64(amount)
    .build();
```

See [CallBuilder & ERC20 Helpers](/sdk/call-builder) for full documentation.

### Canonicalization

The process of transforming data into a standard form before hashing. Actions are sorted to ensure identical outputs regardless of insertion order.

### `cargo-agent`

A Cargo subcommand CLI for agent development workflow: `cargo agent new`, `cargo agent build`, `cargo agent test`, `cargo agent pack`, `cargo agent list`.

See [`cargo agent` CLI Reference](/sdk/cli-reference) for full documentation.

### Codec

The deterministic binary encoding/decoding system. Uses little-endian integers and length-prefixed byte arrays.

### Commitment

A cryptographic hash that binds data without revealing it. The kernel produces `input_commitment` and `action_commitment`.

### Constraint

A rule that validates agent output. Constraints enforce limits on position size, leverage, etc.

### ConstraintSetV1

The structure defining constraint parameters:
```rust
pub struct ConstraintSetV1 {
    pub max_position_notional: u64,
    pub max_leverage_bps: u32,
    // ...
}
```

### constraint_set_hash

A SHA-256 hash of the constraint set, included in the journal to verify which constraints were applied.

## D

### Determinism

The property that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. Required for zkVM execution.

## E

### ELF

Executable and Linkable Format. The compiled zkVM guest binary format used by RISC Zero.

### ExecutionStatus

The outcome of kernel execution:
- `Success` (0x01): Constraints passed
- `Failure` (0x02): Constraints violated

### execution_nonce

A monotonic counter for replay protection. Must increment with each execution.

## G

### Groth16

A zero-knowledge proof system used by RISC Zero for succinct proofs that can be verified on-chain.

### Guest Program

Code that runs inside the zkVM. The kernel guest decodes inputs, executes agents, and commits the journal.

## H

### Hard Failure

A fundamental error (wrong version, code hash mismatch) that aborts proof generation. No valid proof is produced.

## I

### imageId

A cryptographic hash of the zkVM guest ELF binary. Uniquely identifies the compiled kernel + agent combination. Registered on-chain for verification.

### input_commitment

SHA-256 hash of the encoded KernelInputV1. Binds the proof to specific inputs.

### input_root

An external state root (e.g., market snapshot hash) included in the input for additional verification.

## J

### Journal

The public output of a zkVM execution. Contains commitments, status, and metadata. Fixed size of 209 bytes.

## K

### Kernel

The consensus-critical execution environment. Decodes inputs, runs agents, enforces constraints, and produces journals.

### KernelInputV1

The input structure for kernel execution:
```rust
pub struct KernelInputV1 {
    pub protocol_version: u32,
    pub kernel_version: u32,
    pub agent_id: [u8; 32],
    // ...
}
```

### KernelJournalV1

The output journal structure. 209 bytes, contains all commitments and execution status.

### KernelVault

The on-chain contract that holds capital and executes verified agent actions.

## O

### opaque_agent_inputs

Raw bytes passed to the agent. The kernel doesn't interpret these; the agent is responsible for parsing.

## P

### Protocol Version

The wire format version for encoding/decoding. Currently 1.

### Proof

A cryptographic proof (specifically Groth16) that demonstrates correct execution without revealing the computation.

## R

### Receipt

The combination of a zkVM proof (seal) and its journal. Produced by the prover.

### RISC Zero

The zero-knowledge virtual machine platform used by the Execution Kernel.

## S

### Seal

The Groth16 proof component of a receipt. Approximately 260 bytes.

### SHA-256

The cryptographic hash function used for all commitments in the kernel.

### Soft Failure

A constraint violation that produces a valid proof with Failure status. No actions are executed.

### StateSnapshotV1

A 36-byte structure containing equity and timestamp data for cooldown/drawdown constraints.

## T

### `TestHarness`

A fluent API for testing agents with minimal boilerplate:

```rust
let result = TestHarness::new()
    .input(my_input.encode())
    .execute(agent_main);

result.assert_action_count(2);
```

See [Testing](/sdk/testing) for full documentation.

## V

### Vault

An on-chain contract that holds capital and delegates decision-making to agents.

### ViolationReason

An enum identifying which constraint was violated:
```rust
pub enum ViolationReason {
    InvalidOutputStructure,
    UnknownActionType,
    AssetNotWhitelisted,
    PositionTooLarge,
    LeverageTooHigh,
    DrawdownExceeded,
    CooldownNotElapsed,
    InvalidStateSnapshot,
    InvalidConstraintSet,
    InvalidActionPayload,
}
```

## Z

### zkVM

Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine. Executes programs and produces cryptographic proofs of correct execution.
