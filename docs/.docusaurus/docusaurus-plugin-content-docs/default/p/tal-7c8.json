It enables L2 contracts to make trust decisions based on L1 economic security without requiring L2 users to pay L1 gas costs for every stake lookup. The bridge consists of three contracts: TALStakingBridgeL1 on Ethereum, TALStakingBridgeL2 on Tokamak L2, and TALSlashingConditionsL1 for slash execution on L1.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"architecture/overview":{"id":"architecture/overview","title":"Architecture Overview","description":"Tokamak AI Layer (TAL) is an ERC-8004 compliant infrastructure layer that provides trustless AI agent discovery, reputation management, and execution verification. The system is deployed across two layers: Ethereum L1 for economic security via TON Staking, and Tokamak L2 (Optimism-based) for low-cost registry operations and validation logic. This split allows TAL to inherit Ethereum's security guarantees for staking and slashing while keeping high-frequency operations like feedback submission and validation affordable on L2.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"architecture/trust-model":{"id":"architecture/trust-model","title":"Trust Model","description":"TAL's trust model is designed around the principle that different use cases require different security guarantees.
