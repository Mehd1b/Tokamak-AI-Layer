  "description": "Tokamak AI Layer (TAL) is an ERC-8004 compliant infrastructure layer that provides trustless AI agent discovery, reputation management, and execution verification. The system is deployed across two layers: Ethereum L1 for economic security via TON Staking, and Tokamak L2 (Optimism-based) for low-cost registry operations and validation logic. This split allows TAL to inherit Ethereum's security guarantees for staking and slashing while keeping high-frequency operations like feedback submission and validation affordable on L2.",
