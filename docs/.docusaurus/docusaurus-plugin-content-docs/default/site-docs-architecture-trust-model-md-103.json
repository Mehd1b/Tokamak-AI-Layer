  "description": "TAL's trust model is designed around the principle that different use cases require different security guarantees. A low-stakes chatbot lookup needs only reputation feedback, while a DeFi strategy execution requires cryptographic proof of correct computation backed by slashable economic stake. This page covers the security assumptions, mathematical foundations, and enforcement mechanisms behind each trust tier.",
